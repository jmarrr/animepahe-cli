A command-line interface for downloading anime episodes from AnimePahe.ru with support for batch downloads, episode ranges, quality selection, export functionality, ZIP archive creation, and automatic updates.

## ⚠️ Beta Notice

## 🚀 Installation

### Windows
1. Download the latest `animepahe-cli-beta.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Danushka-Madushan/animepahe-cli/releases) page
2. Place the executable in your desired directory
3. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in that directory

### Building from Source

#### Windows/Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danushka-Madushan/animepahe-cli.git
cd animepahe-cli
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release
```

#### macOS (ARM64/Apple Silicon)
macOS requires a patch to the Abseil dependency for ARM64 compatibility:

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install cmake

# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/Danushka-Madushan/animepahe-cli.git
cd animepahe-cli
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-arch arm64"

# Patch Abseil for ARM64 compatibility
# Edit: build/_deps/absl-src/absl/copts/AbseilConfigureCopts.cmake
# Find line ~15: if(APPLE AND CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES [[Clang]])
# Add after that line:
#   if(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS MATCHES "arm64" OR CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "arm64|aarch64")
#     set(ABSL_RANDOM_RANDEN_COPTS "${ABSL_RANDOM_HWAES_ARM64_FLAGS}")
#   else()
# Then add matching endif() before the elseif on line ~60

# Reconfigure and build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-arch arm64"
cmake --build . --config Release

# Binary will be at: build/animepahe-cli-beta
```

**Note**: This is a community-contributed workaround. Official macOS support is not planned by the maintainer.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Stream Proxy Integration
- **Direct Links**: All extracted links are automatically proxied through the [stream-proxy-worker](https://github.com/Danushka-Madushan/stream-proxy-worker) at `dl.gst-hunter.workers.dev/stream/`
- **Ready to Use**: Exported links can be directly opened in browsers, media players (VLC, MPV, etc.), or download managers without additional processing
- **Streaming Capable**: Links support both progressive download and streaming playback
- **No Authentication Required**: Proxied links bypass the need for browser headers or cookies
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any application that supports HTTP(S) streams

### Download Feature
- **Direct Downloads**: Episodes are downloaded directly through the CLI tool to the current working directory
- **Real-time Progress**: Live download progress with detailed statistics including:
  - Current download speed (MB/s)
  - Estimated time of arrival (ETA)
  - Percentage completion
- **Automatic Retry**: Failed downloads are automatically retried with exponential backoff:
  - Maximum 3 retry attempts per file
  - Progressive delays: 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds
  - Automatic cleanup of failed partial downloads
- **Automatic Naming**: Downloaded files are automatically named with proper episode numbering and series information

### Self-Updating Feature
- Use `--upgrade` to automatically download and install the latest version
- The upgrade argument can be used independently without any other flags
- Automatically checks for updates and replaces the current executable
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing configurations

### Episode Selection
- **Default behavior**: When `-e` or `--episodes` is not provided, all episodes are downloaded
- **`all`**: Explicitly downloads all available episodes
- **Single episode**: Use a single number like `3` to download one episode
- **Range format**: Use formats like `1-12` or `5-25` for specific episode ranges
- Episode selection applies to both download and export operations

### Quality Selection
- **`-1`**: Selects the lowest available quality
- **`0`**: Selects the maximum available quality (default behavior)
- **Custom values**: Specify target quality without the 'p' suffix (e.g., `720`, `1080`, `360`)
- If no quality is specified, automatically falls back to maximum available quality
- If a custom quality is not available, the tool automatically falls back to the maximum available quality

### Language Selection
- **`jp`**: Selects Japanese audio (default behavior)
- **`zh`**: Selects Chinese audio/dub when available
- **`en`**: Selects English audio/dub when available
- **Automatic Detection**: Intelligently detects language by checking episode metadata for language indicators
- **Smart Fallback**: If requested language is unavailable, automatically falls back to available options
- **Works with Quality**: Can be combined with any quality setting for precise control
- **Note**: Language availability varies by anime series; not all series have all language options

### Export Functionality
- Use `-x` or `--export` to generate download links without downloading
- **Proxied Links**: All exported links are automatically proxied through the stream-proxy-worker for direct download/streaming capability
- Default export filename is `links.txt`
- Use `-f` or `--filename` with `-x` to specify a custom export filename
- Custom filename can include path information for organized exports
- When episodes are not specified with export, all episodes are exported by default
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Import into download managers (IDM, JDownloader, etc.)
  - Stream directly in media players (VLC, MPV, etc.)
  - Share download-ready links
  - Batch processing with external tools

### Archive Support
- **Complete ZIP functionality**: Compress all downloaded episodes into a ZIP archive after successful downloads
- **Source file management**: Use `--rm-source` flag with `-z` to automatically delete original video files after successful ZIP creation
- **Automatic naming**: ZIP archives are automatically named based on the anime series title
- **Progress indication**: Real-time progress display during compression process
- **Archive features**:
  - Maintains original file structure and naming within the archive
  - Preserves file timestamps and metadata
  - Creates compressed archives to save disk space
  - Handles large file sizes efficiently

### Platform Support
- **Windows**: Fully supported with native executable
- **Linux**: Potential future support under consideration
- **macOS**: Buildable from source on ARM64 (Apple Silicon) with patches (see macOS build instructions above)

### Dependencies

- **kuba--/zip**: ZIP archive creation library

### Build Requirements
- CMake 3.5 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler

- Windows development environment

## 🛠 Known Issues
- Language selection may not work with every anime, as availability depends on the source content
- Network timeouts may occur with slow connections
- Large batch downloads may consume significant system resources
- Update feature requires internet connection and appropriate permissions
- Some edge cases may cause unexpected behavior (beta version)
- **kwik.cx requires `cf_clearance` (see below)** — without it, every download fails with `Failed to Get Kwik ... StatusCode: 403`.

## 🔑 Bypassing Cloudflare on kwik.cx

The CLI cannot solve Cloudflare's interactive JS challenge that protects `kwik.cx` (no HTTP client can — it needs a real browser). The workaround is to reuse the cookie your own browser already obtained when it visited kwik.cx.

**One-time per ~30 minutes (the cookie's lifetime):**

1. Open <https://kwik.cx> in Chrome/Edge. The page auto-passes the "Just a moment…" challenge.
2. DevTools → **Application** → **Cookies** → `https://kwik.cx`. Copy the value of the `cf_clearance` row.
3. DevTools → **Console** → run `navigator.userAgent` and copy the string.
4. Set both as environment variables before running the CLI:

   ```powershell
   $env:KWIK_COOKIE = "cf_clearance=<paste value>"
   $env:KWIK_UA     = "<paste userAgent>"
   ./animepahe-cli-beta -l "https://animepahe.<tld>/anime/<uuid>" -e all
   ```

   On macOS / Linux:

   ```sh
   export KWIK_COOKIE="cf_clearance=<paste value>"
   export KWIK_UA="<paste userAgent>"
   ./animepahe-cli-beta -l "https://animepahe.<tld>/anime/<uuid>" -e all
   ```

When kwik 403s mid-run, the cookie has expired — reload kwik.cx in the browser, copy the new value, retry.

Yes it's hassle. A no-cookie fix would need either a paid Cloudflare Workers Browser Rendering plan or a hosted browser-automation service; neither felt worth the cost for a personal tool. PRs welcome.

## 🚧 Upcoming Features

- **Enhanced Progress Display**: Additional statistics and visual improvements
- **Configuration File Support**: Save user preferences for quality and download settings
- **Stream without Downloading**: Stream provided series to a player like `mpv` without downloading
- **Batch Series Download**: Download multiple series to a single directory
